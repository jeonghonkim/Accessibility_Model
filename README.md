# Accessibility_Model

`CBRE - Location Intelligence`
<br />Accessibility Model Ver.3
<br />Completed as of March 21, 2023
<br><br>

> **Summary** <br>
 
This arcpy tool allows users to calculate drive times, miles, number of turn right and left, traffic volumes
decays from starting points in major roads or streets to target destinations. It uses one csv file, which includes 
market name, latitude, and longitude fields, as an input. With the lat, long values, it locates market sites and 
creates buffers with user assgiend miles from the markets and starting points, which were the intersections between 
marekts and buffers. Also this tool creates routes and directions and allows users to customize departure time, 
wihch will affect the drive time. After running this tool, it adds four feature layers, which were markets, starts,
buffers and routes, to the current map in a project, and the markets and routes layers have statistics tables.

* *Workspace* &nbsp;|&nbsp; The current project's geodatabase is the default value
* *Title Name* &nbsp;|&nbsp; There should be no space in this parameter because it will be the name of new feature dataset in the workspace. 
* *Target CSV* &nbsp;|&nbsp; The csv should include three fields, which represent name, latitude value and logitude value for the target markets.
* *Latitude Field* &nbsp;|&nbsp; You can select the latitude field in the entered csv file. 
* *Longitutde Field* &nbsp;|&nbsp; You can select the longitude field in the entered csv file.
* *Buffer Distance* &nbsp;|&nbsp; You can enter the mile-distance from market locations as you wish.
* *Departure Time* &nbsp;|&nbsp; You can enter exact time will generate drive times. The currnet time will be applied if you select the clock symbol.

* *_AllStreets* &nbsp;|&nbsp; The street points are generated starting points from intersections between the buffers and streets.
* *_Buffers* &nbsp;|&nbsp; The buffer features are generated by the market locations and the buffere distance you entered.
* *_Directions* &nbsp;|&nbsp; The directions are from the routes after solving Closest-Facility analysis with '_AllStreets' as incidents and '_Markets_Original' as facilities. The number of turn right and left of each routes can be calculated by the direction.
* *_Markets_Original* &nbsp;|&nbsp; The point feature class is generated by the entered csv file. It shows only the locations.
* *_Markets_Summary* &nbsp;|&nbsp; This feature class has a summary statistic table including number of starting points, drive time, drive miles, number of turn right and left, and traffics.
* *_Routes_Original* &nbsp;|&nbsp; The lines are the routes from 'AllStreets' to '_Markets_Original'.
* *_Routes_TrafficTurns* &nbsp;|&nbsp; This feeature class includes each route's drive time, drive mile, number of turn right and left, and traffics.

> **Detailed Steps** <br>


<br>**1. Create analysis objects** <br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*1) Feature dataset*<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Creating a feature dataset has multiple benefits. First, you can run the analysis multiple times with different feature names. Also, you can easily find the feature analysis outcomes in different feature dataset. The project title name you enter would be the feature datasetanme.<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*2) Markets and buffers and starting road points*<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once you run the tool after entering the prepared csv file with name, latitude and longitude as well as the buffer-mile distance, it will create market locations as well as buffers feature layers. They will be saved in the generated feature dataset. Starting points are the intersection between the assigned street or roads layers and the generated buffers. You can change the 'major_roads' path in the code as you wish, such as all streets or major roads. All streets in US are used in this analysis.<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*3) Multipart to single part*<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The generated starting points can be a multipart feature point layer. In order to make all points as unique starts, use the multipart to single part geoprocessing tool.<br><br>

        # Set parameters
        work_dbs = arcpy.GetParameterAsText(0) # workspace, current workspace
        title_name = arcpy.GetParameterAsText(1) # project title / feature dataset name, String
        trgt_csv = arcpy.GetParameterAsText(2) # target site csv, table or table view
        lat_field = arcpy.GetParameterAsText(3) # latitude field in target sv, field
        long_field = arcpy.GetParameterAsText(4) # long field in target csv, field
        buff_dis = arcpy.GetParameterAsText(5) # "0.25 Miles" Default, linear unit
        depart_time = arcpy.GetParameterAsText(6) # date & time, date

        # Define project, map, and workspace
        arcpy.env.workspace = work_dbs
        workspace = work_dbs
        aprx = arcpy.mp.ArcGISProject("CURRENT") # Current Project
        aprxMap = aprx.listMaps("Map")[0] # Dafault Map
        out_coordinate_system = arcpy.SpatialReference("WGS 1984")

        # 1. Create analysis objects
        # 1) Feature Dataset
        arcpy.management.CreateFeatureDataset(workspace, title_name, out_coordinate_system)
        accessbility_fd = os.path.join(workspace, title_name)

        # 2) Markets, buffers, and starting road points
        # Markets
        market_p = os.path.join(accessbility_fd, title_name+"_Markets_Original")
        arcpy.management.XYTableToPoint(trgt_csv, market_p, long_field, lat_field, out_coordinate_system)
        # Buffers
        buffer = os.path.join(accessbility_fd, title_name+"_Buffers")
        arcpy.Buffer_analysis(market_p, buffer, buff_dis) 
        # Starting road points
        major_roads = "Streets"
        start_multi = os.path.join(accessbility_fd, title_name+"_Start_Multi")        
        arcpy.Intersect_analysis([buffer, major_roads], start_multi, "", "", "point")

        # 3) Multipart to singlepart
        start_p = os.path.join(accessbility_fd, title_name+"_AllStreets")
        arcpy.MultipartToSinglepart_management(start_multi, start_p)
        arcpy.management.Delete(start_multi)

**2. Generate routes and directions** <br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*1) Use Closest-Facility nax module in Network Analysis*<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Creating a closest-facility layer with nax module to get routes and directions from starting points to markets. This tool's network datasource is ArcGIS Online, which means that it will consume credits if you run this tool. You can use this tool without credit consumption if you have your own network dataset and change the datapath to the nds in your local drive. The analysis outcomes include drive time in minutes and drive distances in miles. Also the drive times is calculated by the entered time as a departure time. Because the nax module is used in this analysis, the desired output features, which were routes and directions, in the CloesestFacility objects are exported to the created feature dataset.<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*2) Filter the routes heading different markets*<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since this tool's one of the most significant purpose is calculating accessibility of many differnt markets 'at once', it use Closest-Facility to meausre the values. However, if some of markets locate closely each other, interruptions might happnes. For example, some starting points generated at Market-1 can heads to different markets. Most of the cases happen when the points locate in highways or roads without u-turn. By filtering feature with different market-name and route-name, those outliers can be removed.<br><br>

        # 2. Generate routes and riections
        # 1) Use Closest-Facility nax module
        # Set NETWORKDATASET object variables
        input_facilities = market_p
        input_incidents = start_p
        output_routes = os.path.join(accessbility_fd, title_name+"_Routes_Original")
        output_directions = os.path.join(accessbility_fd, title_name+"_Directions")
        
        # Instantiate a ClosestFacility solver object using esri source - consume credits!
        closest_facility = arcpy.nax.ClosestFacility("https://www.arcgis.com/")        
        nd_travel_modes = arcpy.nax.GetTravelModes("https://www.arcgis.com/")
        travel_mode = nd_travel_modes["Driving Time"]

        # Set ClosestFacility properties
        closest_facility.travelMode = travel_mode
        closest_facility.timeUnits = arcpy.nax.TimeUnits.Minutes
        closest_facility.defaultTargetFacilityCount = 1
        closest_facility.routeShapeType = arcpy.nax.RouteShapeType.TrueShapeWithMeasures
        closest_facility.returnDirections = True
        closest_facility.timeOfDay = datetime.datetime.strptime(depart_time, '%m/%d/%Y %I:%M:%S %p')
        closest_facility.timeOfDayUsage = arcpy.nax.TimeOfDayUsage.DepartureTime
        closest_facility.timeZone = arcpy.nax.TimeZoneUsage.UTC
        closest_facility.travelDirection = arcpy.nax.TravelDirection.ToFacility
        closest_facility.distanceUnits = arcpy.nax.DistanceUnits.Miles
        closest_facility.directionsDistanceUnits = arcpy.nax.DistanceUnits.Miles
        
        # Load Closest Facility inputs
        closest_facility.load(arcpy.nax.ClosestFacilityInputDataType.Facilities, input_facilities)
        closest_facility.load(arcpy.nax.ClosestFacilityInputDataType.Incidents, input_incidents)
        
        # Solve the analysis
        result = closest_facility.solve()
        
        # Export the routes and directions to feature classes
        if result.solveSucceeded:
            result.export(arcpy.nax.ClosestFacilityOutputDataType.Routes, output_routes)
            result.export(arcpy.nax.ClosestFacilityOutputDataType.Directions, output_directions)
        else:
            print("Solve failed")
            print(result.solverMessages(arcpy.nax.MessageSeverity.All))
        
        # 2) Filter the routes heading different markets
        # Add fields and split 'Name' field with Markets(Facility) and Roads(Incident)
        arcpy.AddField_management(output_routes, "Name_MarketID", "TEXT")
        arcpy.AddField_management(output_routes, "Name_RoadID", "TEXT")
        with arcpy.da.UpdateCursor(output_routes, ["Name", "Name_RoadID", "Name_MarketID"]) as cursor:
            for row in cursor:
                row[1] = row[0].split(" - ")[0]
                row[2] = row[0].split(" - ")[1]
                cursor.updateRow(row)
        
        # Select routes having same 'Name_RoadID' and 'Name_MarketID' to filter incidents falling into other markets
        routes_selected = arcpy.management.SelectLayerByAttribute(output_routes, 'NEW_SELECTION', 'Name_RoadID = Name_MarketID')
        routes_filtered = os.path.join(accessbility_fd, title_name+"_Routes_Filtered")
        arcpy.management.CopyFeatures(routes_selected, routes_filtered)
